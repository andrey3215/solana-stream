## What's New in v1.1.0

- Refreshed starter layout and docs to highlight trading hooks
- Yellowstone Geyser gRPC connection upgraded to an NAPI-RS-powered client for better backpressure
- NAPI-powered Shreds client/decoder so TypeScript can tap near-native throughput
- Improved backpressure handling and up to 4x streaming efficiency (400% improvement)
- Faster real-time Geyser streams for TypeScript clients with lower overhead

## Production-Ready Geyser Client (TypeScript Best Practices)

- Ping/Pong handling to keep Yellowstone gRPC streams alive
- Exponential reconnect backoff plus `fromSlot` gap recovery
- Bounded in-memory queue with drop logging for backpressure safety
- Update subscriptions by writing a new request to the stream (no reconnect)
- Optional runtime metrics logging (rates, queue size, drops)
- Default filters drop vote/failed transactions to reduce traffic

Tip: start with slots, then add filters as needed. When resuming from `fromSlot`,
duplicates are expected.

## Performance Highlights

- NAPI-powered Geyser gRPC and Shreds client/decoder for high-throughput streaming
- TypeScript ergonomics with native performance under the hood

## Installation

```bash
npm install @validators-dao/solana-stream-sdk
```

Or with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @validators-dao/solana-stream-sdk
```

## Usage

### Geyser Client (TypeScript)

For a production-ready runner (reconnects, backpressure handling, metrics),
see https://github.com/ValidatorsDAO/solana-stream/tree/main/client/geyser-ts.

Minimal SDK usage (filters defined in code):

```typescript
import {
  CommitmentLevel,
  SubscribeRequestFilterTransactions,
  GeyserClient,
  bs58,
} from '@validators-dao/solana-stream-sdk'
import 'dotenv/config'

const PUMP_FUN_PROGRAM_ID = '6EF8rrecthR5Dkzon8Nwu78hRvfCKubJ14M5uBEwF6P'

const pumpfun: SubscribeRequestFilterTransactions = {
  vote: false,
  failed: false,
  accountInclude: [PUMP_FUN_PROGRAM_ID],
  accountExclude: [],
  accountRequired: [],
}

const request = {
  accounts: {},
  slots: {},
  transactions: { pumpfun },
  transactionsStatus: {},
  blocks: {},
  blocksMeta: {},
  entry: {},
  accountsDataSlice: [],
  commitment: CommitmentLevel.PROCESSED,
}

const main = async () => {
  const endpoint = process.env.GEYSER_ENDPOINT || 'http://localhost:10000'
  const token = process.env.X_TOKEN?.trim()
  const client = new GeyserClient(endpoint, token || undefined, undefined)

  await client.connect()
  const stream = await client.subscribe()

  stream.on('data', (data: any) => {
    if (data?.ping != undefined) {
      stream.write({ ping: { id: 1 } }, () => undefined)
      return
    }
    if (data?.pong != undefined) {
      return
    }
    if (data?.transaction != undefined) {
      const signature = data.transaction.transaction.signature
      const txSignature = bs58.encode(new Uint8Array(signature))

      // TODO: Add your trade logic here.
      console.log('tx:', txSignature)
    }
  })

  await new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
    stream.write(request, (err: any) => {
      if (!err) {
        resolve()
      } else {
        console.error('Request error:', err)
        reject(err)
      }
    })
  })
}

void main()
```

If your endpoint requires authentication, set the `X_TOKEN` environment variable with your gRPC token.
Please note that the endpoint in the example is for demonstration purposes. Replace it with your actual endpoint.

### Shreds Client

For a working starter that includes latency checks, see
https://github.com/ValidatorsDAO/solana-stream/tree/main/client/shreds-ts.

Here's a minimal example:

```typescript
import {
  ShredsClient,
  ShredsClientCommitmentLevel,
  // decodeSolanaEntries,
} from '@validators-dao/solana-stream-sdk'
import 'dotenv/config'

const endpoint = process.env.SHREDS_ENDPOINT!

const client = new ShredsClient(endpoint)

// The filter is experimental
const request = {
  accounts: {},
  transactions: {},
  slots: {},
  commitment: ShredsClientCommitmentLevel.Processed,
}

const connect = () => {
  console.log('Connecting to:', endpoint)

  client.subscribeEntries(
    JSON.stringify(request),
    (_error: any, buffer: any) => {
      if (!buffer) {
        return
      }
      const { slot } = JSON.parse(buffer)

      // You can decode entries as needed
      // const decodedEntries = decodeSolanaEntries(new Uint8Array(entries))

      console.log('slot:', slot)
    },
  )
}

connect()
```

Ensure the environment variable `SHREDS_ENDPOINT` is set correctly.
