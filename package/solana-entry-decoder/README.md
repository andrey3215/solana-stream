# @validators-dao/solana-entry-decoder

A TypeScript utility provided by Validators DAO for decoding Solana shred entry data.

This package is designed to decode Solana entries from shreds, making it easier to work with real-time data streams from the Solana blockchain.

## Why Rust?

TypeScript alone cannot decode Solana shreds effectively. Therefore, Rust is utilized for efficient decoding, converting the data into JSON format suitable for handling in TypeScript environments.

## Leveraging NAPI instead of WASM

This utility leverages **NAPI (Node-API)** instead of WebAssembly (WASM) to decode Solana shred entry data, providing significant practical advantages.

Node-API - Node.js: https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#node-api

### Benefits of Using NAPI:

- **Performance**: NAPI delivers near-native performance by directly interfacing with Rust code through bindings, minimizing overhead compared to WebAssembly.

- **Seamless Integration**: NAPI simplifies the interoperation between Node.js and Rust, enabling straightforward calls and efficient memory management without extensive tooling or additional complexity.

- **Memory Efficiency**: Efficient memory handling with NAPI significantly reduces risks associated with memory leaks or unnecessary garbage collection, common pitfalls when using WASM.

- **Enhanced Debugging and Maintainability**: Debugging native modules built with NAPI offers clearer stack traces and robust debugging capabilities, overcoming the opaque debugging difficulties often encountered with WASM.

- **Wide Compatibility**: Modules built with NAPI are natively compatible across various Node.js versions without requiring extra compilation steps or environment-specific adjustments.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @validators-dao/solana-entry-decoder
```

Or using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @validators-dao/solana-entry-decoder
```

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Node.js ES Modules)

To directly import this package, you'll need to use the Node.js `require` function:

```typescript
import { createRequire } from 'node:module'
const require = createRequire(import.meta.url)
const { decodeSolanaEntries } = require('@validators-dao/solana-entry-decoder')
```

### Recommended Usage

For TypeScript projects, it's recommended to import directly from [Solana Stream SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@validators-dao/solana-stream-sdk), which exports the decoder in a more convenient way:

```bash
pnpm add @validators-dao/solana-stream-sdk
```

```typescript
import { decodeSolanaEntries } from '@validators-dao/solana-stream-sdk'
```

You can find comprehensive usage examples [here](https://github.com/ValidatorsDAO/solana-stream/tree/main/client/shreds-ts).

## Multi-Platform Build

To build binaries for multiple platforms (cross-compilation), you must first install Rust targets for each desired OS and architecture. Execute the following commands once on your machine to enable cross-platform builds:

```
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu      # Linux x64
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu     # Linux ARM64
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin          # macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin           # macOS x64 (Intel)
```

Here's a concise README section in English that clearly states this is for macOS specifically:

### Cross-compilation for Linux (macOS)

On macOS, to cross-compile for Linux targets (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`), you must install the following toolchains:

```bash
brew tap messense/macos-cross-toolchains
brew install x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu zig
```

### For Windows Users

For now please use WSL2 and follow the Linux instructions.

## Build packages

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm build

// or from the root of the monorepo
pnpm -F @validators-dao/solana-entry-decoder build
```

## Repository

This utility is part of the [Solana Stream Monorepo](https://github.com/ValidatorsDAO/solana-stream).
