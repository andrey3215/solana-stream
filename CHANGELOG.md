# Changelog

## 2.0.0 - 2026-09-17 — Transaction v1

Published 2026-09-17: crates.io `solana-stream-sdk` 2.0.0; npm `@validators-dao/solana-stream-sdk` 2.0.0, `@validators-dao/solana-shreds-client` 2.0.0, `@validators-dao/solana-entry-decoder` 2.5.0 (native decoders rebuilt for darwin/linux × x64/arm64). Migration: [docs/transaction-v1.md](docs/transaction-v1.md).

- Rust SDK 2.0.0, Node.js SDK/client 2.0.0 and entry decoder 2.5.0 (see the [migration guide](docs/transaction-v1.md)).
- Decode legacy, v0 and v1 entries with the Agave 4.2.2 wire schema in Rust, UDP reconstruction and the native Node.js decoder. Use `solana_stream_sdk::decode_entries` instead of a legacy `bincode` decoder.
- Move Rust public transaction types to the compatible modular Solana crates and require Rust 1.96.1. The optional `udp` feature remains enabled by default.
- Update Yellowstone dependencies to Rust client 13.5/protobuf 12.7 and Node.js client 7.0.1, preserving v1 configuration presence and values.
- Return a present Node.js v1 `config.priorityFee` as an exact decimal string, including zero, preserving values above JavaScript's safe integer limit.
- Keep the existing Shredstream gRPC method and field numbers, provider-independent endpoint selection and local protobuf definitions.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-06-26

- Updated the Rust Yellowstone client to `yellowstone-grpc-client@13.1.1` and protobuf crate to `yellowstone-grpc-proto@12.5.0`, matching the current stable upstream 13.x client line.
- Removed legacy `yellowstone_grpc_proto::plugin` re-export aliases because upstream 12.5.0 no longer ships the `plugin` module.
- Added public aliases for Yellowstone 13.x deshred subscription types, token-account expansion controls, and cuckoo compressed account filter helpers.
- Updated Rust Geyser sample builders for new optional protobuf fields: `token_accounts`, `cuckoo_accounts_filter`, and `cuckoo_account_include`.
- Confirmed the TypeScript SDK remains on current upstream `@triton-one/yellowstone-grpc@5.0.9`.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-06-26

- Updated the TypeScript SDK and starter clients to Solana Kit (`@solana/kit`) for RPC block-time lookups.
- Updated the TypeScript Yellowstone client dependency to `@triton-one/yellowstone-grpc@5.0.9`.
- Updated the TypeScript build toolchain to pnpm 11, TypeScript 6, tsup 8.5, and Node 24 typings.
- Updated Rust lockfile dependencies within the current Agave 3.x compatible line and moved the workspace toolchain to Rust 1.89.
- Reduced known RustSec findings versus the previous lockfile without adding new advisories; remaining findings are inherited from Agave/Solana transitive dependencies.
- Documented the Yellowstone status: Agave 4.0.2 server/plugin support is available upstream in `rpcpool/yellowstone-grpc` `v13.3.0+solana.4.0.2`, while this SDK keeps the Rust Yellowstone public API on 10.x until a breaking 13.x migration removes or replaces the legacy `plugin` re-exports.

## 1.2.2 - 2026-06-25

- Fixed Direct Shreds UDP merge test coverage to match the create-first detail backfill behavior.
- Published `@validators-dao/solana-stream-sdk@1.2.2` to npm to align with the already published Rust crate.
